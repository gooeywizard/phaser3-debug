# Phaser 3 Debug
A simple debug scene that makes it easy to 1) pause at any time and 2) see current stats on any or all sprites and bodies.

NOTE: There is currently no build version. If you want to use this in your own project, either copy the DebugScene.js file, or wait until I create a nice build you can import.

## Run the Demo
1) Clone this repository.
2) `npm install`
3) `npm start`

While it is running, press 'P' to pause/unpause.
